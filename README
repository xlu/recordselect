RecordSelect
============

(c) 2011 - Xiaoming Lu

Background: Modify record_select to use Thinking Sphinx search instead of traditional database search (eg Mysql search). Also want to allow user to 
search by record id, instead of only text field. 

Model: 
Needs to set up record_select to choose whether to disallow Thinking Sphinx search. By default, if :wurl_disable_thinking_sphinx is not set,
record_select will use Thinking Sphinx search. If :wurl_allow_search_by_id is set, then when user types in valid record id in the search box,
record_select will search by id, using model.find_by_id(id). 
Example:
record_select :per_page => 10, :search_on => 'title', :order_by=>'title',
                :text_search =>:full, :model=>:feed, :label=>'record_select_item',
                :wurl_allow_search_by_id=>true
                # optional :wurl_disable_thinking_sphinx=>true
Of course you also need to set up is_index block to use Thinking Sphinx search.

This depends on the excellent Paginator gem by Bruce Williams. This simple gem is available at paginator.rubyforge.org.
